Installation Guide 


(This should probably be step 1.You can probably just pull a .config folder.)


You need to intall a recent version of nvim. Best to grab a prebuilt executable from a tarball.

You should probaly run sudo apt-get update sudo apt-get upgrade then install node js. You should then install
nvm (node version manager). You can use node version manager to get an up to date version of nodejs that can run 
the coc language server or whatever language server you might want to be running. 

by this point you have
1. Installed an up to date nvim
2. Installed an up to date nodejs using nvm

Now pull packer.nvim onto your packpath. You can check your packpath with the following command.

`set packpath?` 

One packer is installed on your repo you should install tmux.

(This should probably be step 1.Once you have tmux you can probably just pull a .config folder.)
